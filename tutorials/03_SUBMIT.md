# CoGames Tutorial: Submit & View Results

This notebook walks through submitting a policy to the CoGames leaderboard and viewing your results.


## Prerequisites

- Run from the repo root with your virtual environment activated.
- You need the files required to build a submission bundle.


Optional: confirm the CLI is available:

```bash
cogames --help
```


## Step 1 — Log in

Authenticate before submitting or checking the leaderboard.

```bash
cogames login
```

## Step 2 — Build a submission bundle

The canonical workflow is:
1. Build `submission.zip` with `cogames create-bundle`
2. Upload that bundle with `cogames upload`
3. Submit it to a season


Tip: find your run id and checkpoint by listing `./train_dir`:

```bash
ls -lt train_dir
ls -lt train_dir/<RUN_ID>
```

Expected output (example):

```text
train_dir/
  176850340101/
  176850219234/
```

The newest folder name is your `RUN_ID`. Inside that run:

```text
train_dir/176850340101/
  model_000001.pt
```

Use the policy or checkpoint path, plus any extra runtime files or setup your policy needs, when creating the bundle.

```bash
cogames create-bundle -p <policy-or-checkpoint> -o submission.zip [-f <extra-path> ...] [--setup-script <setup.py>]
```

If your policy needs extra runtime files or setup, include them here. `agent/COGAMES_SUBMISSION.md` has a full repo example.


## Step 3 — Upload the bundle

Upload the prepared bundle:

```bash
cogames upload -p ./submission.zip -n my_policy_name --no-submit
```


## Step 4 — Dry run (optional)

Validate the bundle locally without uploading:

```bash
cogames upload -p ./submission.zip -n my_policy_name --dry-run
```


## Step 5 — Submit to a season

Submit the uploaded policy to a season:

```bash
cogames submit my_policy_name --season beta-teams-small
```

List available seasons:

```bash
cogames season list
```

Note: Scores can take a while to appear after submission.


## Step 6 — View your submissions

```bash
cogames submissions
```


## Step 7 — View the leaderboard

```bash
cogames leaderboard --season beta-teams-small
```


## Troubleshooting

- **Auth errors**: run `cogames login` again.
- **Module not found / 1011 during qualifying**: rebuild `submission.zip` with every runtime file and setup step your policy needs.
  `agent/COGAMES_SUBMISSION.md` has a full repo example.
- **Invalid policy path**: ensure `-p` points to an existing policy, checkpoint, or bundle.
- **Local vs S3 checkpoints**: local training saves files under `./train_dir/`. Cloud training may require downloading or referencing the S3 bundle.
